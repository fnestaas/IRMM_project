# IRMM Project
In this project, we wanted to assess potential costs and benefits of using machine learning models in predictive maintenence in aircraft engines.
We take an adversarial perspective to investigate the worst-case costs when perturbations to "regular" signals are bounded. 

### Instructions
To run the models, do the following:
1. clone the git repo
1. download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predictive-maintenance/data
1. save the data to a directory which has the same name as "SOURCE_DIRECTORY" in the .env file
1. install the requirements from requirements.txt
1. Run clean_data.py
1. Run prepare_data.py
1. train a model by running lstm.py
